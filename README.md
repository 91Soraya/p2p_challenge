# The Rick & Morty Challenge

To complete this challenge you will have to fix all known bugs (and maybe unknown bugs as well!) and add different features.

Later, you will be reviewing each other's code and thus, you should write all code in a new bracnh.

In order to create a new branch you can code in, follow the instructions:
```base
# Create a new bracnh
$ git checkout -b solution
```
Every time you complete a bug or create a feature:
```bash
# stage files
$ git add . 

# save changes
$ git commit -m"<which bug/feature you solved>"

# update GitHub for the first time
$ git push -u origin solution

# any next update
$ git push
```
